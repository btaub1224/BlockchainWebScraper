# BlockchainWebScraper
Web Scraper that will take a blockchain.com transaction URL and find the closest coin base from that url with the help of BFS.

Written in Python, using Selenium for automating.

I decided to use the on screen interactable buttons to navigate as opposed to the JSON as I wanted to practice interacting with web page elements.
